# CodeBookk

> An interactive browser-based coding environment like a Jupyter Notebook, but for Javascript, with many additional features added in.
Bundling and transpiling code directly in the browser. This is a task normally done by running Webpack and Babel at your terminal! You will execute users' code safely in the browser just like how famous services like CodeSandBox and CodePen do. 

### To Do
> Deploy this project using a multi-package architecture to NPM, where your friends and employers can easily download and run your project.

## Goals Completed

    Built a complex and interesting app using a package-based architecture

    Understood the challenges of in-browser code transpiling and and processing

    Secured the app against potential security exploits

    Safely execute user-provided code directly in the browser

    Run a code editor directly in the browser - the same editor used by VSCode!

    Leverage Web Assembly to run a code bundler directly in the browser at lightning-fast speeds

    Use the internals of Redux to manually test out your business logic


    Deploy your app to the NPM registry, where others can easily use it
